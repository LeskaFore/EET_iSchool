<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>Tim Blankemeyer, Emma Clarke, and Katrina Gertz are a group of MLIS Candidates from the <a href = 'https://ischool.uw.edu/'>University of Washington's Information School</a>, interested in leveraging open data and open source tools to help solve complex problems.</p>
<p>For this project, we've partnered with the Puget Sound Partnership to design a scalable data cleaning and analysis pipeline as well as an interactive visualization prototype to show what's working to restore Puget Sound.</p>
