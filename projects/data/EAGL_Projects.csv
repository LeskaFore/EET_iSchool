Volunteers removed Slender Arrowhead by hand pulling.  volunteers and contractors also placed 28,500 sq. ft. of bottom barrier fabric, anchored with sandbags.  Bottom barriers were estimated to be about 80% effective after two years of coverage.  Mason Conservation District experimented with three different aquatic herbicides to control the plant. Reward (diquat dibromide) worked well to control the submerged vegetation, but did not affect root corwns, tubers, or rhizomes.  Sonar (flouridone) provided excellent control in the laboratory, but no control in the lake. Lake residents designed and used an annovative tent-like structure to contain the herbicide around the target plants, but the herbicide was still ineffective.  Rodeo (glyphosate) only controls plants that extend above the water line (though it controls them very well).  Little of the Slender Arrowhead in Mason Lake extends above the water line sufficiently to allow foliar application of this herbicide.  At the beginning of the project, the recipient estimated that Slender Arrowhead covered about 4.5 acres of the littorial area of Mason Lake.

The County also participated in the DIP/SIS process.  In addition to the follow-up in the Eld Inlet basin, water quality monitoring was also accomplished in McClane, Schneider, and Kennedy Creeks.  Very few compliance issues were identified.  All agricultural sites were referred to Thurston CD.  Suspect septic systems were dye traced and none were found failing.  Dog waste was identified as a potential pollution source in the Sunset Beach neighborhood, but was dealt with through a partnership of Thurston County and a neighborhood resident.  A letter identifying the problem and asking for compliance was sent and the resident installed dog poop baggie stations and distributed educational brochures. Mason CD convened and facilitated the Totten/Eld Technical Advisory Group meeting with input from affected local agencies and local citizens.  They worked with Ecology staff to draft a Water Quality Implementation Plan.  Farm planning efforts from the mid-90's were evaluated and deemed effective and still providing benefit to the properties and to water quality.  An inventory of BMPs implemented during inactive grant periods was developed and provided as part of the final reporting requirements.  Agricultural inventories were updated in both Thurston and Mason County portions of the watershed.  Thirty-seven farm plans were developed and/or updated.  A BMP implementation tracking and follow-up program was developed.  Mason CD assisted 62 landowners in implementing 123 BMPs.  Ecology approved BMPs were designed and implemented with technical assistance from Mason CD through new and updated farm plans.  the BMPs implemented included: 2 acres of tree and shrub establishment, 4,925 feet of riparian fencing, and 22 acres of riparian forest buffer.

This innovative partnership will be based on an inter-local agreement between Jefferson, Mason, and Kitsap counties and Port Gamble S'Klallam and Skokomish tribes and will utilize a private non-profit community development lending institution to provide a ""one stop"" financing program to homeowners for on-site septic system repairs.","This grant funding made possible development of a permanent lending mechanism built through a public/private partnership.  An Advisory Board with public health and lender representatives produced formal program guidelines and lending policies, developed and carried out a marketing plan, and continues to oversee the lending activities undertaken by the non-profit lender.  Funding of the improvement loans was shared between this grant source and private loan capital held by the non-profit lender on a 62.5 percent public/37.5 percent private basis.  The project did not accomplish any on-site system repairs within the Port Gamble S’Klallam or Skokomish Tribal reservations. The homes and facilities on the Skokomish Reservation are all monitored by tribal staff and receive design services and financial assistance for repairs through the U. S. Indian Health Service.Water Quality and Environmental Outcomes The anticipated project outcomes included replacement of on-site systems, financial assistance to distressed homeowners, and education for system owners about proper operation and maintenance of their sewage systems, all of which would lead to improved water quality in water courses and marine waters.  The recipient made 40 system repairs funded with grant dollars. While this project did not include water quality monitoring, ambient stream monitoring data provided by the Kitsap County Storm and Surface Water Management Program indicated improvement in fecal coliform levels in some streams where on-site system repairs were made in their up gradient watersheds.  Performance Items and Deliverables The key deliverable was a revolving loan mechanism that incorporated outreach and education elements. Kitsap County contracted with ShoreBank Enterprise Cascadia (EC) for development and operation of the lending mechanism. EC established an advisory body which guided program policies and procedures and provided oversight throughout the term of the project.   EC produced marketing materials used by local health professionals, environmental educators, and private sewage contractors for outreach to system owners.  In addition, EC created a website that contains information and allows for completion of an on-line loan application.  During the project period, 164 owners made inquiries about repair loans and 101 applications were received; 50 applications were approved and 40 repairs completed with regulatory approval.  The lender provided quarterly reports containing information on system location, condition, repair components, and project costs.  Thirty-six percent of the 50 approved loans were made to those with incomes less than 60 percent of the median family income for the three county area; 56 percent to those with incomes under 80 percent.  To encourage continuing operational and maintenance attention to the improved on-site sewage systems, EC included a periodic maintenance requirement in the loan documents and provided an option for additional borrowing up to $1,750 over five years following completion of repairs to fund system monitoring and maintenance.     Additional Comments: Ambient monitoring by local jurisdictions will help to inform the question of measurable water quality impacts for programs like this one.

The project would reduce and prevent adverse impacts by assisting in implementation of a cumulative effects analysis and regulatory program for forest practices in target watersheds.","Sampling methods were in accordance with the Timber Fish and Wildlife Program's Ambient Monitoring Program Manual (included in grant file).  A report was prepared on stream characteristics, riparian shade, pool habitat, large woody debris (LWD), and spawning gravel fine sediment. Many stream segments in the study area are sensitive to temperature increases, and most did not have adequate shade to maintain temperatures within state standards.  Most segments rated poorly for abundance of functional key LWD pieces.  The riparian stands need more conifers to increase shade and to provide large, rot-resistant pieces of LWD. Excessive levels of fine sediment were found in the majority of streams. Forest practices appear to have disturbed stream channels, removed riparian vegetation, and increased erosion.  Watershed analysis prescriptions in sensitive areas can reduce future impacts.  Effects from other land-uses, such as residential development, must be addressed to improve or maintain habitat in the long run.

Although Fish and Wildlife staff worked with the steering committee and initially supported the idea of stocking grass carp, they changed their minds at the last minute and denied a grass carp stocking permit for Lake Limerick.  They had serious concerns about inlet and outlet structures restricting the passage of salmon.  Therefore, the committee, with approval from the Lake residents, decided to continue with the whole lake Sonar treatment, but to follow-up the treatment with diver inspection, hand-pulling, bottom barrier installation, and/or partial Sonar treatment in the year following the Sonar treatment.  The Plan was amended accordingly. During the summer of 1996, Lake Limerick was treated with Sonar.  Concentrations were initially made up to 20 ppb and declined to half that amount over a two-week period.  Fluridone (Sonar's active ingredient) samples were taken at intervals, and every two weeks, the applicator applied enough Sonar to bring the whole lake concentration back to 20 ppb.  Sonar was applied four times. Initial results seem promising with a fall survey showing about a 90 percent decrease in Brazilian elodea biomass.

Farms were prioritized on the basis of impact to water quality due to direct access of livestock to surface waters. Of a total of 327 active farms, 53 were ranked high priority.  The inventory database was updated regularly.  Subbasins were also prioritized on the basis of evident degradation, and the potential for restoration to improve salmon production, habitat and water quality.  Landowners were contacted through four separate mailings and follow-up phone calls.  Sixty-three farm plans were completed; thirteen for high priority farms in high priority subbasins.  Twenty-six of 53 priority farms in high priority subbasins implemented a total of 97 BMPs.  A total of approximately 360 BMPs were implemented, far exceeding grant requirements.  The District provided information to all landowners regarding the availability of technical assistance, agricultural land tax incentives, conservation easements, land trusts, and cost share incentives.  Four watershed boundary signs were posted on major roads saying, You are in the OAKLAND BAY WATERSHED Please don't pollute our water.  Four cooperators were given conservation farm signs upon completion of projects and farm plans.  Each year the District gave a ""Wildlife Habitat Farm of the Year"" award to a landowner that showed exemplary management of his/her farm.  The award recognized landowners for implementing BMPs and managing their farm to allow for minimal impact.  Landowners were given a 20"" x 24"" sign and were also recognized in the media.  The District offered a Homestead Improvement Program as another incentive to landowners to gain skills necessary to implement BMPs on their own property.  Classes included instruction and hands- on demonstrations of various management practices.

Each year we allocate about $100,000 from our biennial appropriation for high-priority early infestation projects that deal with the control of noxious aquatic weeds like Eurasian watermilfoil.  By taking early and immediate action, it is sometimes possible to eradicate or contain the spread of a noxious plant that has just started to colonize a waterbody.","Milfoil surveys were conducted in the spring of 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 to locate and mark milfoil infestations. Larger milfoil infestations were treated with 2, 4-D in 1999 and 2000. After treatment divers located and hand removed any milfoil plants remaining after herbicide treatment. Due to a 9th Circuit Court decision in early 2001, no herbicide treatment took place that year. Instead the diver hand pulling effort continued and larger milfoil patches were covered with bottom barriers. Unfortunately these manual efforts were not effective and milfoil increased substantially by 2002. This set the project back. The herbicide treatment and diver hand pulling efforts resumed in 2002. Also in 2002, the lake community formed a Lake Management District and now self assess taxes to support this on-going, long-term milfoil control project. In 2003, a grant was awarded to enable the lake group to develop an integrated aquatic vegetation management plan and to continue with milfoil education efforts.",G9900182,AWMF99EI04,I,1999,Aquatics,,,,MASON,14,35,06,Aquatic Invasive Plant Program,MASON COUNTY,MASON LAKE MILFOIL ERADICATION PROJECT,1/1/04,"$47,250.00",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/AThe funds will be used to assist in the construction of the North Bay/Case Inlet wastewater treatment facility for the Allyn-Victor-Lakeland Village service area.,These two purchases are complete and have been partially reimbursed by Ecology (costs exceeded the loan funds available).,L0000011,FP96156,I,1996,Wastewater Facility,,,,MASON,14,35,06,REF 39 - Loan,MASON COUNTY,LAND ACQUISITION FOR NORTH BAY/CASE INLET WATER RECLAMATION FACILITY,12/31/02,"$200,000.00",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A"With this loan for $6,559,688 Ecology has committed loans and grants for the construction phase of the north bay/case inlet project totaling $14,179,688 or 80 percent of the total eligible project cost of $17,816,200.","The wastewater collection system serves approximately 900 connections, approximately 450 of which include grinder pump stations.

The water quality goal was to remove the largest source of contamination from the inner waters of Wollochet Harbor, thus removing a significant obstacle to the possible recertification of shellfish harvest areas there.","The Wollochet Harbor treatment plant was eliminated.  All sewage from the Wollochet Harbor Sewer District was intercepted to Gig Harbor, where it now received the legally required degree of treatment.  A significant source of contamination was removed from inner Wollochet Harbor, enabling the State Health Department to consider recertifying shellfish beds there.  The last primary treatment plant in Ecology's Northwest Regional (and possibly in Washington State) was eliminated.  The District completed two components of this project using the Small Towns Environment Program (STEP) method.  The first part was the installation of a new collection system, including 24 septic tank effluent pumps.  The preliminary estimate for this project, assuming the use of an outside contractor was $95,000.  The District used volunteer labor, their consultant (Gray & Osborne) donated an inspector and the District purchased the materials.  The approximate final cost for this portion was $25,000, a savings of $70,000.  The second part of the work accomplished through using STEP was the landscaping.  The District received a bid for the landscaping work of approximately $45,000.  The District chose to perform the work, for the most part, by themselves.  The total cost for the landscaping project, using volunteer labor, the Labor-Ready manpower pool, and materials procurement by the District, was approximately $17,000, a savings of $28,000.",G0000091,FP00106,I,2000,Wastewater Facility,,,,PIERCE,15,26,06,Public Works Assistance Account,WOLLOCHET HARBOR SEWER DISTRICT,SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT,12/31/02,"$1,411,885.63",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A"Kitsap County will use the money to assess the current level of citizen awareness about stormwater and nonpoint pollution; educate the citizens about their impact on water quality, and promote behavior changes.

Priorities relative to agricultural practices and water quality for many properties have changed, some improved and some degraded relative to the baseline inventory.  The inventory information was incorporated into a mailing list that was used in the outreach effort.  This grant enabled the District to develop 23 farm plans and complete 34 incentive program applications.  Of those applications, 33 incentive grants were awarded through EQUIP and CREP totaling $109,366 to complete projects such as waste storage structures, heavy use area protection, fencing, fish stream improvements, and pasture planting.  District staff developed 54 site specific best management practices designs that conformed with NRCS standards and specifications.  These included (in order of frequency): fencing, heavy use area protection, pasture planting, waste storage structures, waste storage structures, waste storage structure roof, pipeline, roof and runoff management, tree and shrub establishment, diversion, underground outlets, and animal trails and walkways.  Technical and planning services were provided for BMP implementation, including supplies and materials lists, on-site project management to oversee installation, and processing of cost share reimbursement.  A total of 82 BMP implementation projects were completed. WCC crews were used in 10 projects.   Operation and maintenance agreements were signed by landowners at the time cost-share was awarded. District staff inspected completed BMPs regularly for operational problems, effectiveness, and ease of maintenance.  Follow-up assistance was provided to encourage proper maintenance and address any concerns.  Thirteen (13) sites received follow-up BMP monitoring.   In addition, 13 sites were used for BMP demonstration purposes for interested agencies, groups and individuals.  Over the course of the grant, the District responded to complaint referrals from state and local agencies.  These included 12 water quality complaints from Kitsap County Health Department (KCHD) and Department of Ecology, six solid waste complaints from KCHD, four land use referrals and two open space tax program referrals.  In addition to the landowner mailing list mentioned above, the District publicized the project through various methods, including two newspaper articles, 11 District newsletters and 15 public events.

Mason Conservation District conducted an agricultural inventory of landowners and properties ranked for their potential to contribute to non-point source pollution to the lower Union River watershed.  They also developed farm plans with associated Best Management Practices and restoration practices for participating landowners.Hood Canal Salmon Enhancement Group led trained volunteers in a water and sediment sampling effort effort throughout the lower Union River, its tributaries, and the Lynch Cove estuary.  Water samples were collected monthly from 25 stations over the course of one year.  The goal of the sampling effort was to identify sources of fecal coliform pollution and to investigate the potential source of toxic contaminants.  Mason County Department of Health Services (MCDHS) followed up at ""high-risk"" sites (utilizing ranked parcel information and water quality data) to assist in the location and remediation of fecal coliform sources.  MCDHS conducted sanitary surveys and dye testing, when necessary, of on-site wastewater systems with cooperating landowners.  Five hundred and fifty seven properties were evaluated as high, medium or low potential for bacterial pollution to the Union River and its tributaries.As part of the study, over 500 parcels were examined via map and database and ranked for their potential to contribute fecal coliform contamination.  The ranking was based on septic system age, type, and location to waterways.  Sanitary surveys were performed on the parcels most at-risk to contribute fecal coliform.  A conceptual stormwater control plan was completed in an effort to eliminate the Belfair Urban Growth Area as a source of pollution to Lynch Cove and Hood Canal.  The Lower Union River Stormwater Study was completed by Engineering Services Associates in May 2006.  Three community outreach workshops and two stewardship programs were held to engage local citizens and inform them of the current pollution issues in Union River, including updates of the water sampling effort, septic system care and maintenance, status of the Operation and Maintenance Program in the area, proper livestock waste management, and overall farm best management practices.

This technique provides analysis of various water resource management scenarios.  Each series of scenarios will be evaluated for its effect on water quality, water quantity, and fish and wildlife habitat.","The Barker Watershed and Windy Point Shoreline Pollution Identification and Correction Project led by the Kitsap County Health District and with the KCD.  The Health District monitored FC levels from Island Lake, Barker Creek , and other fresh water drainages from Barker Creek and the Windy Point Shorelines.  Fifteen (15) sources were identified, including 9 failing on-site systems, one inadequate trailer dump station, 1 pet waste violation, and 4 livestock handling problems.  All but three requiring further investigation were corrected. The Health District conducted an intensive public education campaign including three public meetings regarding best management practices for on-sites, pet waste, stormwater, pond operation, and farming.  Barker Creek continues to have a closure zone established around it due to exceedances of state primary contact standard for FC and Windy Point remains classified as ""Conditionally Approved"".   Overall, the water quality monitoring did not find a lot of FC sources in this drainage nor any that were directly impacting the stream.   However, the trend monitoring found FC levels are coming down.  Kitsap Conservation District led the Barker Watershed Agricultural Limiting Factors Correction Program to improve poor agricultural practices as potential watershed nonpoint pollution.  Under this program eight farm management plans were written and twenty agricultural best management practices installed including exclusion fencing, and riparian planting.  Six newsletters, eight technical assistance mailings, seventeen public event activities, and thirteen presentations/educational programs were conducted.  Kitsap County Development of Community Development (DCD) led the Barker Watershed Alternative Futures Planning project intended to have land use decision makers understand and protect beneficial watershed uses.  Watershed characterization included a groundwater-surface water model on GIS, measurement of channel complexity, a Hydrologic Simulation Program - Fortran (HSPF) watershed model using precipitation, stream flow, groundwater level and lake level data conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers, GIS land use maps including land cover, sewers, roads, critical areas, wildlife. Two open houses, 6-evening Watershed Academy, and workshops for area residents were conducted.  The Alternatives Futures planning process identified realistic future land use under ""expansive"", ""moderate"", and ""plan trend"" scenarios showing levels of imperviousness and forest cover in a ""virtual build out"".  The Corps of Engineers created a HSPF stream flow model that showed the more urbanized model had more flashy conditions, a modeled greater stream flow to have better fish habitat.  A Riverine Habitat Simulation (RHABSIM) modeled salmon habitat for each HSPF scenario.  During the time of the grant the Barker Creek watershed sub-area plan became part of the Kitsap County Comprehensive Plan.  In a resounding success the ""moderate"" alternative scenario was adopted by the Board of Commissioners in the County's Comprehensive Plan in December 2006.  Accordingly the new Urban Growth Area (UGA) in Barker Creek corridor was decreased from its previous configuration, the only area where the UGA was pulled back.  The Alternative Futures for Water Resources Management was led by the Army Corps of Engineers with the help of the Silverdale Water District (SWD).  SWD installed telemetry-equipped, continuous flow gages on Barker Creek, Clear Creek and Strawberry Creek, and a meteorological station at their office.  The Corps used GMS 6. to develop an integrated groundwater-surface water model of the Barker Creek watershed which gives modelers to assess impacts such as groundwater withdraws, lake levels, and enhanced stormwater infiltration.",G0400345,FP04070,I,2004,Nonpoint Source Activity,,,,KITSAP,15,23,01,Centennial Clean Water Program,KITSAP COUNTY,Barker Creek Watershed Planning & Restoration Project,12/31/07,"$499,992.96",fp04070,Kitsap County,Barker Creek Watershed Integrated Planning,"This project addresses three interrelated issues: water quality, landuse and water use.

A study will be conducted to help determine if failing on-site septic systems and animal waste are significant sources of nutrient pollution to the upper Hood Canal shoreline.,"Kitsap County Health Distric conducted fecal coliform source identification (shoreline surveys) along Kitsap County's developed shoreline during dry and wet seasons.  Eighty-six properties were surveyed which consisted of on-site septic systems (OSS) record search, homeowner/resident interview, field inspection, and water samples and dye test when necessary.  Kitsap Health identified and investigated fecal coliform hotspots and conducted property surveys and investigations in these areas.  County staff provided owners and residents with site-specific suggestions to avoid premature OSS failures, how to keep bacteria and nutrients out of Hood Canal, and enforced correction of failing OSS pursuant to state and local OSS regulations.  Kitsap health presented project methods and results for public and peer workshops.  A subset of Hood Canal shoreline discharges was sampled to continue correlation study of fecal coliform (FC) and nearby control drainages before and after OSS correction to determine FC and nutrient reductions.  This pilot nutrient study was limited to seven cities that were suitable for the investigation based on the ability to estimate or measure flow and whether the failure was found during the spring when groundwater flows are highest.  Kitsap County's upper Hood Canal shoreline does not have a serious OSS failure problem based on project results.  This is supported by Kitsap Health's trend monitoring data for the water year, Sept. 2008.  Nine of the eleven marine water monitoring stations in the project area meet both parts of Washington State's water quality standard for FC.  Thirty-one FC pollution sources related to failing OSS were identified and were either corrected of vacated.  The Lofall area has a serious FC pollution problem which is currently being addressed in the Jump Off Joe PIC project.  Though preliminary pilot nutrient study results show no correlation between FC and nitrate+nitrite nitrogen in shoreline discharges sampled for this project it was found that failing OSS do contribute nitrogen and further investigation is needed.  Pre- and post-FC Source Correction (BACI) results showed statistically significant nutrient reductions at the 95% confidence level after OSS correction compared to controls.",G0600372,FP06SP05,I,2006,On-Site Septic System,,,,KITSAP,15,23,01,Centennial Clean Water Program,KITSAP COUNTY HEALTH DISTRICT,Kitsap County Upper Hood Canal Pollution Identification Correction Project,12/31/08,"$69,999.51",FP06SP05,Kitsap County,Septic System Surveys,0,0,0,0,Not an ESA Listed Basin,Not Statewide,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0The money will be used to conduct shoreline septic system surveys for the properties bordering the Hood Canal and to complete enhancements to the on-site septic system database.,"OSS surveys were conducted between August 2005 and August 2008.  Since July 2005, the County has surveyed 44.4 miles along Hood Canal for shoreline discharges.  Spanning a period of 107 days, over 1,800 water samples have been collected and analyzed for FC from 1,416 individual shoreline sites.  Based on results, the property distance from surface water is the most common factor contributing to identification of on-site septic system (OSS) failure, followed by age of system and previous repairs. Seventy-five of the systems identified as failures were traditional gravity systems.  The County identified close to 2,090 parcels that were developed within 1000 feet of Hood Canal.  29 properties of interest were identified from 27 monitoring locations.  An additional property was identified on the north shore of Hood Canal that occupies a shellfish closure zone.  Sanitary surveys were performed at 17 of the 29 identified properties.  Twelve of the properties were not surveyed either because the property owners did not respond to County requests or the County was unable to contact the owner within the time allotted.  Five of the properties were identified at the end of the project, leaving little time to attempt contact of the residents.  Of the eight properties with identified OSS failures, six were less than twenty feet from surface water, with most of those systems located directly behind the bulkhead.  All eight properties have excessive storm, surface, or ground water that most likely contributed to the onsite system failure.  Five of the failing OSS are repaired, one is at design phase, and one owner has yet to be notified due to the potential intersection of a storm drain with the drainfield.  One failure was visually identified as having a direct discharge out of bulkhead drains.  The County conducted fourteen public meetings, workshops, and water quality-related events to inform homeowners in the Hood Canal region about the project.  Presentations included information on the practices homeowners can implement to reduce fecal coliform and nutrient pollution.  Following are methodologies used and observations obtained throughout the project:  Properties adjacent to and not more than 1000 feet from the shoreline were prioritized for surveys and investigations.  When shoreline discharges were observed, samples of water were collected and tested according to procedures set forth in the project Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and Standar Operating Procedures (SOP).  High FC sample results triggered additional confirmation sampling. The combination of the property address, site description, GPS coordinates, and photos allowed staff to reliably identify the sites for confirmation sampling.  During the project, staff found that samples with high salinity readings had typically low levels of FC; therefore samples were no longer collected at sites with salinity readings above 20 ppt.  Sanitary surveys included a parcel file onsite septic system (OSS) record review, a Carmody Operation & Maintenance database search, and an interview with the homeowner or resident. The property was surveyed to identify the location of OSS components and their condition.  Staff inspected for obvious signs of failure such as surfacing sewage or sewage odors.  Additionally, septic systems were inspected for signs of poor system location or physical damage such as gutter downspouts directed toward system components, or cracked tank lids.  Dye tests were performed when indicated (with permission of the system owner) to identify any outbreaks from the system, incomplete treatment, or grey water discharges.  The sanitary survey provided the opportunity to educate the resident about the proper operation and maintenance of a septic system in order to prolong system life and ways to protect it from unintentional damage.  Non-OSS sources were addressed by recommending owner implement best management practices such as picking up pet waste, composting of yard waste, and surface water runoff management.",G0600378,FP06SP04,I,2007,On-Site Septic System,,,,MASON,15,35,06,Centennial Clean Water Program,MASON COUNTY DEPT OF HEALTH SVCS,Mason County Septic System  Surveys and Database Enhancement,12/31/08,"$320,000.00",FP06SP04,Mason County,Septic System Surveys and Database,0,0,0,0,Not an ESA Listed Basin,Not Statewide,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0"The recipient will use low impact development (LID) practices in the development of Blueberry Park along walkways and trails where the LID uses can be explained with interpretive signs combined with outreach education efforts The project will teach appropriate LID techniques and develop partnerships that will have far-reaching effects throughout the entire region.

The KCHD will correct the identified sources through a combination of public education and enforcement of local on-site sewage and solid waste regulations.  Through this project, the KCHD will determine if fecal coliform pollution sources like failing onsite sewage systems and animal waste are significant sources of nutrient pollution to Jump-Off-Joe Creek and Hood Canal receiving waters, and whether they are reduced after fecal coliform source correction.","Water Quality and Environmental Outcomes KCHD Pollution Identification and Correction (PIC) work in 2008 and 2009 resulted in decreasing FC concentrations in Jump off Joe Creek. FC concentrations at the mouth of Jump off Joe Creek met regulatory standards by June 15, 2009. Consequently, DOH removed the shellfish closure zone at the mouth of Jump off Joe Creek in October 2009. Performance Items and Deliverables In total PIC surveys were performed at 412 properties in the Vinland, Jump off Joe, Lofall and Kinman Creek watersheds and the shoreline was surveyed from NBK-Bangor to Driftwood Keys. Twenty-eight OSS failures were discovered and repaired during the project.  Factors that contributed to the failures were similar to those found in other KCHD PIC projects. OSS age, soil type, water table elevation, proximity to surface waters, physical damage to drainfields and hydraulic overloading of the system by residents contributed to many of the failures found during the project. Additionally seven failing OSS discharging to the beach were discovered and repaired/replaced. Pets, wildlife, and stormwater runoff were also informally observed to be contributors to watershed FC loading. Water quality awareness was raised by educating residential owners/occupants on how to prevent FC pollution. Outreach techniques included public meetings, press releases and door to door parcel surveys, sharing information about how to prevent bacterial and nutrient contamination of Jump Off Joe Creek and Hood Canal.Additional Comments: Provide any other discussion about performance, outcomes, etc., including items that could not be accomplished, that are of note that occurred during the project.During the course of the project FC bacteria concentrations initially decreased in Jump off Joe, Vinland and Kinman Creeks.  By the end of the project, the trend was stationary in Jump off Joe and Vinland Creeks. Water quality in Lofall Creek initially worsened and then improved dramatically in 2011.

A secondary goal was to educate and inform the public, inlcuding agricultural property owners.","Results:  This project was only partially successful in that it identified a number of sources of bacterial contamination, implemented the correction of some of them, and began implementation of some others.  However, it did not bring about an improvement in marine water quality significant enough to maintain the shellfish harvest classification of all of Rocky Bay.  On August 11, 1995, the Washington State Department of Health did downgrade a portion of Rocky Bay, prohibiting commercial shellfish harvest in the affected portion. The study found no continuous major sources of bacterial contamination to Rocky Bay.  This finding demonstrates that the shallow, narrow inner portion of Rocky Bay is extremely sensitive to bacterial contamination, whatever the source.  The inner bay's high sensitivity to low level bacterial contamination may indicate that even the small or intermittent fc contributions, in addition to the background fc concentrations, may be enough to tip the balance from acceptable to unacceptable.  The bright side of this conclusion is that remediation of contaminant sources may be limited to correction of a modest number of small problem areas rather than many larger problem areas. Among the positive outcomes of this project is that Rocky Bay and the watershed are better known and understood, paving the way for a more focused, rapid response to the downgrade that occurred late in the course of the project. During the duration of this grant, a broad-based Closure Response Committee met and formulated a remedial action plan to prevent further water quality deterioration and to restore water quality to the extent that the prohibited area can again be classified as open for commercial shellfish harvest.  The grant project contributed to the known information about Rocky Bay and its watershed. The report makes several recommendations for further sampling, education, and protective land use standards, as follows: - Additional freshwater sampling is needed to better define the sources of bacteria found in some shoreline drains (such as stations 8, 9, and 10), and to evaluate corrections implemented to date. - Further marine water sampling, concurrent with freshwater sampling should be conducted under moderate to heavy rainfall conditions to update existing information on the relationship of marine water quality to freshwater inputs.  Marine water sampling should include sample collection under both ebb and flood tide conditions. - The sanitary survey of shoreline homes, especially adjacent to the prohibited area, should be repeated using a more sensitive method, such as charcoal packets. - TPCHD should establish a regular septic system operation and maintenance schedule for all systems in the watershed, including review of all system components and education of system owners. - An on-going funding source for all watershed monitoring activities needs to be developed.  Funding for on-going agricultural outreach and implementation of BMPs should be included. - Protective land use standards are needed to prevent water quality degradation from watershed development. - Other potential sources of bacterial loading to Rocky Bay, such as wildlife, household pets, bacterial growth in sediments or presence of nonfecal species such as Klebsiella should be evaluated.",G9300180,FP93117,I,1993,On-Site Septic System,,,,PIERCE,15,26,06,,TACOMA-PIERCE CO HEALTH DEPARTMENT,ROCKY BAY SHELLFISH PROTECTION PROJECT THE WATER QUALITY MAY AGAIN COMPLY WITH THE CLASS AA MARINE WATER BACTERIAL STANDARD.,3/15/96,"$93,210.24",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/AThe goal of this project is to develop a watershed management plan for the Liberty Bay and Miller Bay watershed according to the process described in Chapter 400-12 WAC.,"Established a Liberty Bay/Miller Bay watershed management committee to assist with development of a watershed action plan.

This ordinance originally included requirements for installation of sewage control facilities (pumpouts, dump stations and rest rooms), a Health District inspection program, adoption of US Coast Guard marine sanitation device requirements, requirements that floating structures be required to have plumbed sewer lines, and a requirement for marina signage regarding the location and use of sewage control facilities.  The ordinance went through legal review and was presented to the Bremerton-Kitsap County Board of Health for support.  3. In 1997, Sound Options Group, L.L.C., a contractor, was hired to facilitate community input on the new regulation through meetings and work sessions.  4. In May, 1998, the ordinance went before the Board of Health for adoption.  The Board in general supported the ordinance, but did not support installation of sewage facilities or a Health District inspection program.  5. Health District staff continues to work on the regulation based on input from the Board and the regulated community.  It has been seeking consistency; in particular with US Coast Guard law regarding the discharge of untreated sewage from vessels.  The ordinance has been revised to delete the inspection program and the requirement for sewage facilities; these facilities will only be required for new marinas or those undergoing expansion.  The Ordinance is again scheduled to go before the Board this month.  6. Because the Ordinance was not adopted during the grant project period, it was decided that the monitoring task in the grant would be deleted.  The monitoring had been designed to measure water quality improvement with Ordinance implementation.",G9400192,FP94113,I,1994,Nonpoint Source Activity,,,,KITSAP,15,23,06,Centennial Clean Water Program,BREMERTON-KITSAP CO HEALTH DIST,BOAT WASTE CONTROL PROGRAM,12/31/98,"$60,709.00",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A"The Recipient shall use the funds to upgrade the North End Wastewater Treatment Facility.

The plan has not yet been implemented because of lack of funding. This project was driven by a few very dedicated citizens.  Unfortunately many of the other lake residents are committed to solving lake problems, but only if somebody else pays.  The managment approach identified in the plan calls for a whole lake Sonar treatment followed by diver inspection and survey.  The plan will cost about $800,000 to implement with $321,000 needed for the whole lake Sonar treatment.  I doubt if this group will be able to raise the money for this plan.

The cost and water quality benefits of retrofitting existing stormwater facilities throughout the City will be evaluated.  This will enable Seattle to select the best locations and technologies for future water qualit investments.,"Twenty storms were monitored at the Downstream Defender and Vortechs BMP sites and eight storms were monitored at the Stormceptor site, where the installation occurred later in the project. Antecedent conditions, storm intensity, and storm flow rates relative to treatment system design flows are among the variety of factors that influence the performance of any stormwater treatment system and contribute to the statistical variation in pollutant removal rates.  To reduce or at least quantify the uncertainty associated with the performance of each treatment technology, the project used two sampling approaches: the event mean concentration (EMC) method and the discrete flow composite (DFC) sample method.  The results were as follows.  None of the BMPs tested performed well in removing TSS, metals, or nutrients.  Removal rates for most pollutants were frequently less than zero for the Downstream Defender and Vortechs units.  Although the Stormceptor unit achieved overall positive removals for most pollutants (TSS, total copper and zinc, total phosphorus, and soluble reactive phosphorus), removal efficiencies were relatively low (less than 15 percent).  None of the three BMPs met the Washington State Department of Ecology standard (Ecology, 2002) for basic stormwater treatment devices (80 percent TSS removal). Low removal rates for TSS may be caused by several factors, including (1) low TSS concentrations in the incoming stormwater runoff, (2) resuspension of accumulated sediment during subsequent storms, (3) inaccuracy in the analytical method used to measure TSS, and (4) ineffectiveness of the particular treatment technology.  Despite the low monitored TSS removal rates, sediment accumulation consistently increased throughout the test period at Downstream Defender and Vortechs units.  The depth of sediment in the sump of each unit was measured after each storm event.  Re-suspension of previously deposited material did not appear to be a problem during the test period.  Due to a relatively short test period and low TSS in the untreated runoff, sediment accumulation in the Stormceptor unit did not increase markedly with each sampling event.  Removal of other particulate bound pollutants like total metals and total phosphorus should be consistent with TSS.  All three BMPs achieved very low removals for total metals (less than 10 percent) and total phosphorus (less than 5 percent). None of the BMPs tested are expected to be effective in removing dissolved pollutants (that is, dissolved metals and soluble reactive phosphorus), because these systems function primarily as sedimentation devices. All three BMPs achieved positive removals for TPH-motor oil (ranging from about 60 to 70 percent and from 45.6 to 63 percent for the full and reduced data sets, respectively).  The timing of the grab sampling used to capture samples, however, may have biased the magnitude of this performance.  The methodology used for sampling TPH targeted sample collection at the beginning of each event, when the TPH concentration at the inlet was at its highest Due to the less than stellar overall performance of these stormwater treatment devices, SPU has determined that these devices are not cost effective and is not recommending their use for general purpose stormwater system retrofits in the City of Seattle.",G9500232,FP95140,I,1995,Stormwater,,,,KING,15,11,07,Centennial Clean Water Program,SEATTLE CITY OF,STORMWATER TREATMENT PROJECT,9/30/04,"$221,250.00",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A"Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department's project will implement critical elements of the Gig Harbor Ground Water Management Program.

The project was designed to provide a comprehensive, on-site evaluation of all septic systems with potential for impact on Rocky Bay, in addition to addressing known problem systems.  This approach was intended to provide encompassing and long lasting water quality improvements and reverse the trend of bacterial contamination of Rocky Bay so that the commercial shellfish growing area prohibited for shellfish harvest could be reopened.","Overall, the project was undertaken by the TPCHD to expedite repair work on known nearshore septic system failures, and to locate and correct any new failures that may have occurred since a shoreline sanitary survey that was conducted in 1993 and 1994.  TPCHD offered free septic system review and dye testing to all waterfront and nearshore homeowners.  Owners of failing systems were eligible to apply for grants of 65 percent of the cost of repair design and installation.  A maximum grant of $11,000 per system was allowed each property owner.  Detailed Results: The grant agreement contained four tasks: 1. Project Admin & Mgmt - $5,200; 2. Public Notification - $2,052; 3. Identification of Failing Septic Systems - $25,115; 4. Septic System Repair Grants to Homeowners - $150,000.  Project Administration: The project was administered and managed effectively and all required submittals were received.  Public  Notification: Extensive public notification occurred, including brochures mailed and handed out to about 600 residents in the area, word of mouth, door-to-door fliers to about 100 residents in the Rocky Bay area, and a few directed letters to certain owners.  The assistance program was discussed at six Rocky Bay Action Team meetings that occurred during the course of this project.  Identification of Failing Septic Systems: Six systems were dye tested or reviewed for signs of failure.  One system was found to be failing by dye testing and one site did not have a failing septic system, but had a pit privy (outhouse) that was used during weekend visits.  The remaining systems dye tested/reviewed did not show signs of failure.  One property owner who had been reluctant to cooperate with TPCHD staff in the past did consent to a dye test.  Another choose to stop occupying his property, and two others continued to refuse to respond to requests for access, but were not located in areas where failures were suspected.  Septic System Repair Grants to Homeowners: Two systems known to be failing were repaired without dye testing.  Two new situations were also corrected.  It was originally expected that a total of up to 30 systems would be tested and up to 12 failing systems would be detected.  Increased owner awareness, which may have been a result of the sanitary survey work, and part time occupancy of many properties, resulted in far fewer systems being tested and determined to be failing than originally anticipated. Low numbers of failing on-site systems were determined, and some relatively inexpensive repairs resulted in far less expenditure of grant funds than was originally anticipated. Conclusions: The project attempted to provide property owners the highest possible cost share without committing local agency funds to subsidize repairs.  If structured differently, more project resources may have gone to sanitary survey work.  The project was successful in resolving two known failing waterfront systems and in locating two additional sites where the system was failing or problematic.  The project also made it easier to access one waterfront property owned by an individual who refused earlier efforts to dye test.  (That test showed the system functioning properly, but without the availability of grant funding for potential repair, the system's status may never have been determined.)  Repairs performed during this project have undoubtedly improved water quality in Rocky Bay.  In conjunction with improvement in stormwater practices in the nearshore areas, the repairs appear to have reversed much of the bacterial contamination that has impacted commercial shellfish harvest in the Bay.  Recent testing shows that water quality in the Bay seems to be improving.  Continued sampling is needed to track water quality and locate new sources as they develop. Project Manager Comment: This grant did not require, nor did the TPCHD feel it had (or currently has) the capability to dye test every system.  Many local health departments feel limited in their ability to test all systems in an area.  While some health departments feel they can inspect an individual system after they have solid evidence of a failure of that system, many of them feel there is no adequate mechanism to provide for a complete survey in a problem (or other) area.  Identifying surface failures can be difficult without easy site access, and sub-surface failures are difficult to identify without a dye test.  Some easier way to survey systems in general and identify sub-surface failures, as well as gain more effective access to identify surface failures, needs to be developed, and may be a good subject for a pilot project or some type of special/focused grant. Something needs to be done to more effectively protect public water from contamination by specific failing systems while respecting the desires for private property rights.",G9700145,SOS97006,I,1997,On-Site Septic System,,,,PIERCE,15,26,06,Centennial Clean Water Program,TACOMA-PIERCE CO HEALTH DEPARTMENT,ROCKY BAY ON-SITE REPAIR PROJECT,12/31/98,"$32,443.20",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A"The Bremerton-Kitsap County Health District will use this money to restore good water quality in Port Gamble Bay to allow the upgrade of recently closed commercial shellfish beds back to a classification level of ""approved"".

The Burley Lagoon On-Site Repair Project was successful at accomplishing the three original goals.  The identification and repair of nine failing on-site sewage systems improved the water quality in Burley Lagoon, decreased public health concerns for shoreline residents and contributed to the upgrade of much of the lagoon.  All performance requirements, financial vouchers, and maintenance of this project appeared to be submitted in a timely manner.  The project requested 3 extensions.

In particular the addressing of fecal coliform pollution in the south end of Bay sufficient enough to reclassify the bay from prohibited to approved for shellfish harvesting was a high priority.  To achieve basin-wide water quality improvement a watershed stream assessment was conducted, water quality improvement plans developed and stream habitat restoration projects implemented and public outreach conducted.","The Kitsap Conservation District conducted a watershed stream assessment of the basin and completed a report entitled: Port Gamble Bay Watershed Stream Assessment.  Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe completed Stream restoration designs for four projects  Implemented four stream restoration projects, projects included removal of read canary grass, creek rechannelization, large woody debris placement, instream erosion control, stream bank reconfiguration/stabilization, streambank revegetation and installation of a baffle system in a beaver dam in improve waterflow and fish passage.  Kitsap Conservation District provided technical assistance and developed farm plans for a number a small farms in the basin that were suspected of contributing to nonpoint pollution and were in need of improving Agricultural Best Management Practices.  Kitsap Conservation District conducted a watershed farm survey to identify management practices and potential nonpoint pollution problems.  Kitsap Conservation District worked with a local landowner to develop a model small farm for the purpose of conducting tours for landowners interested in improving agricultural management practices.  Bremerton/Kitsap Health District amended their solid waste ordinance so that it addresses poorly managed agricultural operations.  In association with this the Health District also completed the development of their Pollution Identification and Correction Procedures to address and enforce animal waste control regulations.  Bremerton/Kitsap Health District conducted a sanitary survey in the Burley lagoon Watershed.  The survey work under this grant has been completed and preliminary reporting information has been provided under Grant no. G9800287 (Burley watershed Prevention/ Restoration project).  The final report on this project will be completed at the end of 2001.  Retrofitted an exiting stormwater structure in the Gamblewood Housing development with a swirl concentrator stormwater treatment device. Conducted an outreach program to promote a conservation easement purchase program.  One conservation easement was purchase (via other funds) through this outreach program.  Kitsap Public Utility District #1 conducted several environmental education programs including: project Wet classes for teachers; Water quality/habitat display for Port Gamble Bay Shellfish Closure; coordinating volunteers for stream restoration projects; conducting community workshops on water quality BMP's and for the reopening of shellfish beds in South Port Gamble Bay.  University of Washington Sea Grant produced six issues of a newsletter dedicated to project activities.  Project implementation activities partially contributed to the reclassification of shellfish harvesting in Cedar Cove (south Port Gamble Bay) from restricted to approved. Note: Task 4 items A and B  (Basin Planning) were not completed due in part to Kitsap County switching there pilot basin focus to a more at risk basin.  The down zoning of the Gamble Creek watershed from 2 ½ acres to five-acre parcels relieved some of the potential development pressures in the basin.  A key player in the basin planning the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe Natural Resources Department went through some reorganization which made made it more difficult for them to participate in the project.  $29,500 was original allocated for compiling these subtasks. $97,190 will be deobligated from this grant.

The project evaluated the feasibility of both repair of on-site systems and off-site drainfields as treatment alternatives.  By educating and involving the shoreline communities, the project was intended to lead to the repair or replacement of failing OSS near outer outer Quartermaster Harbor.  The project also included a monitoring component to document levels of fecal contamination in sediments, shellfish and freshwater streams, and to help identify the sources of fecal contamination.","The activities carried out under the grant have successfully met or exceeded the major project objectives enumerated above. 1.  Community Involvement.  Seattle/King County Department of Public Health (KCH) sent letters to 82 owners and 87 non-owner occupants of residences in the affected neighborhoods.  This mailing list was refined for subsequent mailings.  KCH held two community meetings and a presentation was made to the Vashon Community Council to discuss the project.  A fourth meeting is scheduled for December 2000.  A citizens advisory committee (CAC) was formed with volunteers at the first meeting.  The CAC met approximately every four to six weeks for the two years duration of the project, and the committee has additional meetings scheduled.  The CAC developed a set of recommended actions to begin or continue through 2001 focusing on implementation.  The CAC is interested in demonstrating the feasibility of one or more upland drainfields.  2. On-Site Technical Consultation.  Following the initial public meeting, KCH sent letters to 108 homeowners offering free septic system assessments and free workshops on Caring For Your Septic System.  Only three respondents requested the free assessments by KCH.  As an alternative, KCH contracted with a consultant to conduct an on-site sewage system study, with results reported primarily as statistics to encourage cooperation.  The consultant found that approximately 30% of the homes investigated had sewage discharging onto the beach.  The consultant's report concluded that while there may may be sites in the study areas that could support an OSS, all study areas would be better served with off-site drainfields, either individual or community.  The report included an assessment of potential off-site, upland drainfield locations.  3. Monitoring.  The project included water quality, sediment and shellfish monitoring focusing on beachfront communities in the outer Quartermaster Harbor area.  Results of the stream water quality sampling indicated relatively high daily variability in coliform concentrations, with moderate to levels of contamination.  The streams are not considered the primary source of fecal contamination to the shellfish areas because of low flows and variable results.  Consistently higher levels of fecal coliforms were found in previous sampling of bulkhead drains, which would be the primary discharge point of failing systems.  Fecal coliform levels in all butter clams exceeded the 14/100ml standard for commercial shellfish sale.  4. Educational Outreach.  KCH assembled existing educational information about OSS into an educational packet for community residents. These were handed out during six OSS workshops held on Vashon Island.  In addition, KCH distributed the packets as part of door to door educational program in the outer Quartermaster Harbor beachfront neighborhoods.  KCH left packets at 70 houses; 28 residents were home and KCH discussed the project and OSS maintenance with those who were interested.",G9800269,SOS98001,I,1998,On-Site Septic System,,,,KING,15,34,07,Centennial Clean Water Program,SEATTLE-KING CO PUBLIC HEALTH DEPT,QUARTERMASTER HARBOR ON-SITE SYSTEM REMEDIATION,12/31/01,"$71,953.80",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A"The Bremerton-Kitsap County Health District will use the money to identify and correct sources of water pollution such as failing on-site septic systems, poor livestock management practices, contaminated stormwater, and more.",Completion of on-site system (OSS) sanitary survey from November 1998 to December 2001.

The water quality goal was to remove the largest source of contamination from the inner waters of Wollochet Harbor, thus removing a significant obstacle to the possible recertification of shellfish harvest areas there","The Wollochet Harbor treatment plant was eliminated.  All sewage from the Wollochet Harbor Sewer District was intercepted to Gig Harbor, where it now received the legally required degree of treatment.  A significant source of contamination was removed from inner Wollochet Harbor, enabling the State Health Department to consider recertifying shellfish beds there.  The last primary treatment plant in Ecology's Northwest Regional (and possibly in Washington State) was eliminated.  The District completed two components of this project using the Small Towns Environment Program (STEP) method.  The first part was the installation of a new collection system, including 24 septic tank effluent pumps.  The preliminary estimate for this project, assuming the use of an outside contractor was $95,000.  The District used volunteer labor, their consultant (Gray & Osborne) donated an inspector and the District purchased the materials.

THE IDEA WAS TO DOCUMENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LATERAL MOVEMENT OF BACTERIAL CONTAMINANTS RELEASED FROM ON-SITE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS TO UNDERLYING PERCHED SEASONAL GROUND WATERS, AS A MECHANISM FOR THE TRANSPORT OF CONTAMINATION TO DOWNGRADIENT SURFACE WATER BODIES.","THE PROJECT HAD THE FOLLOWING RESULTS:  THE STUDY INDICATED THAT THERE WAS POTENTIAL FOR HORIZONTAL MIGRATION OF FECAL COLIFORM BACTERIA FROM ON-SITE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS INTO PERCHED SEASONAL WATER TABLES IF THE LATERAL DISTANCE WAS 30 FEET ORLESS AND THE GROUND WAS UNDISTURBED. THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT WAS LESS THAN THREE MONTHS IN A GIVEN YEAR, WHEN THE WATER TABLE REACHED HIGH ENOUGH TO BE WITHIN ONE TO TWO FEET OF THE DRAINFIELD BOTTOMS. AT ONE SITE, WHERE A FOUNDATION FOOTING DRAIN WAS SITUATED DOWNGRADIENT OF AN OPERATING DRAINFIELD, DYE RELEASED INTO AN ON-SITE SYSTEM WAS RECOVERED FROM THE FOOTING DRAIN OUTFALL.

Water quality monitoring wll be conducted to measure the success of the BMPs.,"The Mason Conservation District (MCD) executed the agricultural component of the DIP including BMPs for farm owners.  Cost share was made available to interested landowners.  Farm plans were written to include BMPs such as, riparian fencing to exclude animals away from waterways, retain streamside vegetation, land use application of manure at times and rates to prevent excess nutrients from entering waterways, storage of manure so that it's not susceptible to rain or flood water, and sustain pastures and animal maintenance areas to minimize runoff of nutrients, pathogens, and sediments.  The MCD entered all monitoring results into Ecology's Environmental information system (GIS) map outlining high, medium and low priority properties based on the potential impacts to surface water.  The MCD also conducted a waste stream inventory in the Skokomish watershed.  This inventory identified organic waste streams generated in the Skokomish valley.  The purpose of the inventory was to determine the feasibility of utilizing an anaerobic digester to balance available nutrients in the watershed.  BMP activities A total of 194 BMPs were designed and recommended to be implemented in the watershed, 29,799 feet of riparian fence installed (5.6 miles), 43,300 trees were planted in the riparian areas within the Skokomish watershed, and a total of 71 BMPs were implemented. The MCD worked on 16 stream improvement projects: 1.  Nalley Dike removal, Estuary restoration.  The MCD, The Skokomish Tribe, and Tacoma Power collaborated to restore 108 acres of the Skokomish River tidelands in Phase 1 of a historic estuary restoration project.  Over 300 acres will eventually be restored upon completion of Phase 2.  2.  Installation of large woody debris on the Skokomish main stem. 3. Installation of large woody debris on the south fork of the Skokomish River.  4.  Installation of large woody debris on Vance Creek  5.  Twenty-seven acres were enrolled in the conservation reserve enhancement program (CREP) and 10,500 trees were planted.  6.  Toal, a design for installation of large woody debris at 5 mile creek of the Skokomish River  7.  Installation of large woody debris on the South Fork (Albert)  8.

Enrolled 4.5 acres in CREP on Weaver Creek   The Skokomish TMDL response grant was an effective program and a significant success.  The community can clearly see the improvements achieved in water quality within the watershed.  Water quality in the Skokomish and tributaries has improved beyond expectations since the initiation of the TMDL study in 1999.  All four compliance sites, Weaver, Ten Acre, Purdy Creeks, and the Lower Skokomish River have lower fecal coliform levels.  All TMDL compliance sites, with the exception of Weaver Creek, met TMDL fecal coliform targets prescribed.  Following the TMDL study in 1999 several high pollutant reduction strategies have been developed and successfully implemented, including 5.6 miles of riparian fence, decommissioning of high risk on-site septic systems by the Skokomish Tribe and Mason County, and over 40,000 trees and shrubs planted.

The project will provide public education and outreach, and assess new and improved treatment technologies and implementation feasibility.","The Hood Canal-wide attitude survey and other surveys helped gain valuable information about the population's knowledge, attitudes and practices around water quality problems. It also assessed knowledge about the low dissolved oxygen problem, and knowledge and practices with individual's onsite septic system maintenance.  The assessments of nitrogen reducing technologies to address the dissolved oxygen problems, the various institutional options that exist to address water quality problems from wastewater, and potential policy tools (including economic incentives) that might be used were very fruitful endeavors.  The Hood Canal Coordinating Council anticipates the construction of a Paradise Bay community sewer treatment system within two years. That system will be an MBR system the most effective at removing nitrogen from treated effluent. That system will also be able to replace existing failing onsite systems that have problems passing pathogens and fecal coliform into groundwater, as well as nitrogen. This system will provide up to 280 connections. This accomplishment is a direct result funding from this grant.  The Hood Canal septic loan program was launched in March, 2007, by the Hood Canal Coordinating Council, to serve any business or individual with a failing onsite sewer treatment system in Jefferson, Kitsap or Mason Counties and on the Port Gamble S'Klallam and Skokomish Reservations. It will provide over $6,000,000 of public and private foundation funding to offer low interest loans to repair failing onsite systems, to assist communities in constructing community systems to decommission existing failing onsite systems. This is also a result of funding provided by this grant. It allowed HCCC to fund HCCC staff to do the research and work with the various parties to bring this program to fruition.  Information from the surveys can be used as a basis for new policy initiatives in the future to address wastewater and water quality in the watershed. HCCC staff helped advance Hoodsport-to Skokomish community sewage treatment facility planning forward with its community survey efforts. They also helped get the local government parties together and begin negotiations that resulted in a formal MOA between Mason County, Mason PUD #1 and the Skokomish Tribe. That MOA helps the parties coordinate planning efforts and administer state and federal facility planning and construction funds.

Failing onsite sewage systems are believed to be a main cause of the degraded water quality. Results:  1)  The Mason County Department of Health Services advertised availability of repair funds by a letter to all property owners.  Prooerty owners who failed to respond to the first letter were sent a follow-up letter.  Several were also contracted by phone or in person.  2)  The County also created a filer about the program and distributed it around the community.  3)  Of 41 properties identified in the project area, 14 gave permission for the county to conduct dye tests.  All properties but one were dye tested (the county was never able to schedule a time with the outstanding property owner).  Of the 29 properties that were not inspected, 8 have either no water or no septic.  4)  Properties that would not allow access for dye testing have been flagged in the county's database, & dye tests will be requested at the time of sale or application for building permits.  5)  Three failing septic systeme were replaced.

Local citizens are better informed about the problems of human sewage in Hood Canal and how to prevent problems with and maximize the function of their OSS.  A template is now in place for completing the work of identifying and correcting failing OSS in this watershed and it can also be used elsewhere in Jefferson County. Documenting OSS in the county, beginning with sanitary surveys, will be addressed in the next steps. Loans are available to homeowners for OSS repair. It was learned that shoreline sampling and sanitary surveys work together to identify failing OSS and cannot be relied upon alone Also, surveys must extend further upslope then the immediate shoreline, and that sampling may need to occur in both summer and winter months to adequately address potential.   Having completed sampling at 234 locations in 20 miles of Hood Canal shoreline, the results showed that 2-3% of the locations had significant bacterial counts. It could be reasonably expected to see another 30 hot spots in the remaining 60 miles of shoreline, despite the fact that the area remaining includes some long stretches of uninhabited areas. These areas also contain a high percentage of residences with older and perhaps non-functioning OSS.

Loading was higher coming from the main stem than from the East Fork.  Naylor’s Creek was contributing to the main stem.  Jefferson County and the Conservation District (District) have been trying to locate the cause of the high fecal coliform levels on Naylor’s Creek and will continue to do so.  In regards to temperature data there appears to be no downward trend at any of the stations. Twelve septic systems were discovered to be failing.  Failures were corrected through enforcement of code violations by the County septic team.The District worked with landowners in the Chimacum Creek area to install 14,376 feet of stream fencing; four (4) off-stream water facilities installed; 48.7 acres of riparian buffer was planted; and over three (3) miles of stream channel had aquatic vegetation removed.

In general, a cumulative effect at the watershed level over the long‐term is the best test of pollution correction measures, and continued monitoring will need to be performed to assess performance on environmental outcomes.Water quality sampling was effective at screening the area for impacts from bacterial indicators of pathogens. Enough samples were collected to identify areas as hot spots in need of investigation. However, not enough samples could be taken to fully analyze trends in water quality. The shoreline surveys conducted in this project should be considered a snapshot in time that gives a picture of the bacterial levels at that point in time. Non‐point source pollution is notoriously difficult to trace. However, in at least one case bacterial high hits were traced directly to a failing OSS resulting in repairs and correction of the problem. In several other cases, high hits resulted in higher scrutiny of OSS in the area and even though one system couldn’t be implicated directly, improvements were made to OSS that may have been contributing.Performance Items and Deliverables The project successfully:•	Conducted sanitary surveys of 725 Hood Canal parcels within 500 feet of shoreline.•	Identified potential failing onsite septic systems (OSS) contributing fecal coliform bacteria at levels in excess of the water quality standard. •	Identified and recorded the functional status of OSS for 1,130 properties in the project area. •	Educated homeowners in project area and other interested persons on the proper operation and maintenance of OSS through surveys, direct contact, and four Onsite Septic System Care and Monitoring workshops.•	Facilitated the repair of nine failing OSS and 19 system upgrades.",G0800055,FP08007,I,2008,Nonpoint Source Activity,,,,JEFFERSON,17,24,06,Section 319 Grant Program,JEFFERSON COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH,Hood Canal Clean Water Project,5/31/12,"$385,243.02",FP08007,Jefferson County Public Health,Hood Canal Clean Water Project,The Hood Canal Clean Water Project has two goals.

Survey results were used to create maps of distributions and estimate the basal area coverage in nearshore habitat between Point Hudson and the Port of Port Townsend Boat Haven, at the railroad trestle at the southern end of the Boat Haven, and at the mouth of Chimicum Creek.  Conducted beach seine observations (i.e., demersal fish abundance surveys) annually, using students and citizen volunteers to help with sorting, counting, measuring, and entering data.  Conducted coliform monitoring quarterly from both Boat Haven and the Point Hudson Marina.  Baseline water quality data was collected monthly from 15 stations in Port Townsend Bay.  All eighth grade students from the Port Townsend School District participated in the nearshore component of this program.  These ""labs"" had a hands-on component as well as an educational component.  The data collection and analysis was integrated into the eighth grade science and computer curriculum.  Chimicum High School marine biology students assisted with the monitoring of the offshore stations.  Beach observation/monitoring has been conducted weekly by volunteers at five sites in the study area.  Biannual meetings were held to inform volunteers about trends observed.  A weather station was installed in the Marine Science Center and monitored by volunteers.  Data was entered into a database and compiled into quarterly and annual reports.  Water quality monitoring data was made available to the public via the ""Port Townsend Bay Marine Resource Monitoring Project 1900-2000"" newspaper insert.  8,500 copies of this document were distributed.  Other outreach included public lectures emphasizing regional water quality and nearshore habitat issues, and a series of articles in the local newspaper.

The recipient has not finished the scope of work or the performance requirements set forth in the agreement.  Instead, the city has decided to upgrade the draft comprehensive plan to a facility plan. (See attached November 15, 1999 letter)  They will upgrade the document with their own funds.  The city has been reimbursed approximately 85% of the loan to date.  With the exception of two general issues, the draft plan is essentially approvable as a general sewer plan.  The two issues which could not be resolved during the review of the draft plan are:  the capacity (rerating) analysis related to the treatment capacity of the treatment plant and the capacity analysis/sewer separation issues of the downtown area and the Gaines Street pump station.  While the project is incomplete, I believe Ecology has still received value equivalent to the loan funds we have invested in this project.  At a minimum, no new projects or project expansions can proceed without approval of the comprehensive sewer plan and the submittal of site specific engineering reports.  In order to qualify for Ecology funding for proposed projects, the draft comprehensive sewer plan must be upgraded to a facility plan.

All watershed planning requirements under Chapter 400-12 WAC were fulfilled.  The planning process was mostly on schedule, except toward the end when public meetings were held and comments were received. The County opted for several more public meetings than was required in the grant contract. 3. The County used experiences of the Sequim Bay work to help develop the overall educational strategies for Dungeness.  The County received approval from Ecology to implement the plan developed by the education committee.  Some of the elements that were implemented included a quarterly newsletter, presentations on water quality to area school children, internship programs, a logo contest, and other watershed and water quality related activities. 4. A quality assurance project plan was developed by County staff.  The monitoring and analysis by County staff helped to identify and target problem areas that became an essential part of the overall watershed assessment and problem statement.

There were three major objectives:  1. Develop and implement an aggressive information and education program with the agricultural community as the target audience; 2. Provide technical assistance to the commercial and noncommercial farms within the Quilcene-Dabob watershed as well as other watersheds in the county; and 3. Provide financial assistance to landowners installing agricultural best management practices in the Qulcene-Dabob watershed.,"Results:  1. An information and education plan was developed.  Newsletters, model farm awards, model farm tours, steamside management workshop, and news releases were all implemented.  Most activities were well received by the target audience.  2. The primary objective of technical assistance was to provide help to individuals to solve or prevent nonpoint source water pollution problems associated with agriculture.  Seventy-five percent of the time spent on this task was dedicated to the Quilcene-Dabob Bay's watershed and the other 25 percent of the time was spent in the other watersheds of East Jefferson County.  A total of six conservation plans were developed during the grant period, and three more are in the process of development.  Six of the plans are in the Quilcene-Dabob and three are in other watersheds of the county.  Best management practices (BMPs) ranged from stream fencing, pasture management, animal waste management, and roof runoff management.  3. The final objective was to develop a mechanism by which state funds could be used for the implementation of agricultural BMPs on private farms.  The Recipient was to design a BMP matrix that would detail landowners, acreage, BMPs, cost per BMP, and schedule for implementation.  Since there was not enough money in this project for actual implementation, the information would be used for a future Centennial Clean Water Fund application for BMP implementation.  However, Jefferson County the USDA Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) program had readily available cost-sharing funds that is used for BMP implementation on an individual basis.  The District and landowners opted to stay with the ASCS program, so the funds targeted for the BMP matrix was reassigned to technical assistance. The combination of state funded technical assistance and federally funded BMP implementation seemed to work successfully.  There were approximately 275 acres of farm land that has been treated by conservation planning. The extent of water quality improvements will not be known for several years.  Jefferson County Planning has a water quality monitoring program through which improvements in the county waters will be recorded.",TAX91090,FP91013N,I,1991,Nonpoint Source Activity,,,,JEFFERSON,17,24,06,Centennial Clean Water Program,JEFFERSON CO CONSERVATION DISTRICT,Quilcene/Dabob Watershed Implementtion,12/31/92,"$37,795.53",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A
