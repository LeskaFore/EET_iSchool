The purpose of the permit is to provide Ecology with information on the pollutant loading and average event mean concentrations from representative basins serviced by municipal storm sewer systems. Each basin is to represent a different land use type, so that pollutant export can be correlated with land use within the basins.","09/25/2010 - 10/18/2013","Chris Montague-Breakwell","Ecy Water Quality Program, Southwest Region","","Pierce County Public Works Surface Water Managemen","LEVEL 4: Approved QAPP or SAP.","Ecology Approved QAPP for S8.D","Level 4 - Data Verified and Assessed for Usability in a Formal Study Report","","","",,,,6/13/2013 2:25:37 PM
"WHM_BIO","Biological Monitoring Program","Reviewed","Habitat monitoring, including Status and Trends monitoring","The Freshwater Biological Monitoring Program provides bioassessment services of the ambient biological condition of “reference”, or least disturbed, streams across Washington State.  Data is collected using the protocols for narrow or wide rivers outlined by the Status and Trends Monitoring Program for Watershed Health and Salmon Recovery.  This data is used for long term trend analysis, building assessment models, and providing guidance for restoration and other activities.  Biological resources monitored include benthic macroinvertebrates and periphyton, and we anticipate the addition of other communities sensitive to environmental change.  The Department of Ecology has been collecting biological data since 1993.  The Biological Monitoring Program was established in 2009, with an effort to standardize data quality and improve the coverage of our assessment tools for all regions of Washington State.  Data stored in EIM will meet uniform data quality standards to allow comparison of data among sites and projects, and the use of multiple assessment methods in a statistically defensible manner.","07/13/2010 - 10/06/2014","Karen Adams","Ecy Environmental Assessment Program","","","LEVEL 4: Approved QAPP or SAP.","","Level 3 – Data Verified and Assessed for Usability","","","",,,,
